## Python GUI Assignment (tkinter)

This is a follow up project to the Python Datascience assignment which we have already completed. In this project we will design a GUI using `tkinter` which would have the following overall functionality:

* The GUI would provide the user to select a file from the computer.
* It will have a dropdown menu to toggle between two output options: `Segmentation` and `Bounding-box`
* If `Segmentation` is selected then it should show the segmentation map of the selected image file along with the original image file side-by-side.
* For `Bounding-box` it should display the bounding boxes instead of the segmentation maps.
* We will obtain the segmentation maps and the bounding boxes by taking help from the previous assignment (which you have already done).

In order to be super clear on how the final GUI should function like, here is a sample video showing it.
